        Business Development Manager, Green Light. Specialising in transforming
        the way businesses manage, use and apply IT Solutions. With over 10
        years working and consulting in the Development and Technology space, I
        have jumped the fence from strategy to technical and am working towards
        being a full stack developer. Using my enthusiasm for technology and
        people to ... Getting more young woman into tech is something I feel
        stronly about and so I have joined WitWa, were I have met amazing and
        inspiring woman working on the TechTrails Sub Comittee , where we go to
        schools and help educate students about jobs in STEM. Interested in the
        intersection between IoT and humans I assist Tom Zorde with running

        Born in South Africa, moving to New Zeand at 5 years old - where I lived until I moved to Perth for University.
        Living in rural New Zealand I was not always surounded by technology but I did always have a passiobn for leanring.
        Moving to Berlin in my early 20s is where I discovered my passion for developement, working in Munich
        in a company specilsing in Deep Learning and computer vison.
        From there I knew I wanted to 'jump' the fence and move into a more technical role, she codes has given me the chance to learn these new skills and I am excited to use them.
